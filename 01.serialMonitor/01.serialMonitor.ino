  Learning Intention:
  The students will understand the difference between the inbuilt setup and loop methods,
  and understand the basics of the serial monitor'.
  
  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand the different behaviours of the setup and loop methods
    2.  I can print information to the serial monitor
    3.  I can print information to a new line of the serial monitor
    4.  I understand the impact of having more than one setup or loop methods in my sketch
    5.  I understand `//` and `\/* *\/` comments

// The setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // setup a serial connection and configure the communication speed
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // debug serial connection by printing a conformation to the serial monitor
  Serial.print("Serial monitor is configured to 9600 baud rate");
}

// The loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  Serial.print("Pin-A0:");
  Serial.print(analogRead(A0));
  Serial.print(",");
  Serial.print("Pin-A1:");
  Serial.print(analogRead(A1));
  Serial.print(",");
  Serial.print("Pin-A2:");
  Serial.println(analogRead(A2));
